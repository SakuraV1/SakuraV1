🌐 Operation One Cheat Overview — Open Testing Build - by Sakura ( this overview is made by ai cz im lazy )


🎯 ESP Features
Character Outline ESP Displays a custom outline around enemy players. Does not reflect prone/crouch states or movement—purely positional.


ESP Line Draws a direct line from the center of your screen to the target’s body for instant location tracking.

Look Line Projects a line from the player’s head in the direction they’re facing. Height of the line dynamically reflects crouch or prone status.

Billboard Shows player username and distance (in studs). Clean, readable, and always centered above the target.


🛠️ Cheat Menu & Toggles
Menu Access Press Right Shift to open the cheat menu. Note: Menu is inaccessible during active rounds due to first-person lock.


Color Changer Randomizes colors for all ESP elements except the billboard. Adds flair without sacrificing readability.

Friendly ESP Toggle Global toggle to enable/disable ESP for friendly players.

Look Line Toggle: Enable/disable directional indicators

🧪 Development Notes
No Info Grabber This cheat does not collect or transmit player data. Purely visual enhancements.


Leaderboard Conflict Running the cheat may override the custom leaderboard GUI, reverting to Roblox’s default. This is a known GUI limitation.

Prone/Crouch Detection Still under investigation. Current workaround uses look line height as an indirect indicator.

Custom ESP Model The outline is not based on the native character model. It’s a hand-crafted proxy built through trial and error.

Version Status This is the first iteration of the ESP system. Expect improvements in accuracy, performance, and visual fidelity over time.
